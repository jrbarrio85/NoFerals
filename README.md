Replaces all would be Feral zombies with their "normal" versions.

NOTE: The Wight does not have a "normal" version so the Feral version remains. Just make sure you adjust the speed for Feral zombies in the menu.

NOTE: Replacing zombies is preferred to removal, via probability, so that zombie numbers are maintained.
